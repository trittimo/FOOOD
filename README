FOOOD Site Instructions

To run the server, switch to the flask branch and run
	> py FlaskPackage/FOOODServer.py
Then navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000 to view the website

To view some of our designs, switch to the gh-pages branch
Other branches are probably not important, but you can look at them if you wish

IMPORTANT NOTE: FlaskPackage/constants.py is IMPORTANT but it is ignored in git due to security issues. If you do not have this file in your project, you will have to recreate it (good luck).
